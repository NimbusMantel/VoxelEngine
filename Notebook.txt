Voxel buffer management on the CPU
- Bitmask for each block of voxel children (8*4*4=128 bytes)
- Storage in binary tree 32-bit array
- Path computation: current level is the least significant bit, on left shift per level
- Binary index in the array: ((path | (1 << level)) - 1) or (path + (2^maxLevel >> (maxLevel-level)))
- Binary index to array index: (index >> 3)
- Binary index to bit index: (index & 7)

- maxLevel=23 -> ~2MB voxel buffer management -> ~1GB CPU voxel buffer, ~1GB GPU voxel buffer -> ~1000m^3 voxel data at its lowest level

Voxel buffer on CPU and GPU are synchronized

Voxel strcuture on the GPU
- 32-bit structure: 1-active, 3-index, 4-parent, 8-children, 7-activity, (9-unused)
- 32-bit children: 32-pointer (absolute, refer to the block of voxel data (4*4=16 bytes))
- 32 bit colour: 8-pred, 8-pgreen, 8-pblue, 8-beta       \ "A physically Based Colour Model"
- 32 bit colour: 8-mred, 8-mgreen, 8-mblue, (8-unused)   /  Robert J Oddy, Philip J Willis

Voxel buffer dynamics
- Loading of voxels in order (root -> recursion on children) by requests from the GPU and CPU
- Unloading by suggestions from the GPU checked by the CPU

GPU unloading suggestions
- 6-bit last usage counter (reset every frame for the active voxels)
- 1-bit unused children (toggled once lowest level has been visited -> check with siblings -> recursion to parent)
- memory pressure level calculated by the CPU (default to 127, maximum at 1)
- unused voxels with fallow period >= memory pressure is suggested to the CPU for unloading
- suggestions for blocks to unload given to the CPU via a buffer (atomic array list)

CPU unloading checks
- calculation of the current memory pressure via the amount of memory needs to be inserted and how much space is left
- only unloading of voxel data which isn't in very close proximity to the player (but not in full detail) or needed for physics
