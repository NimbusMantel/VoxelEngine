Voxel buffer management on the CPU
- Bitmask for each block of voxel children (8*4*4=128 bytes)
- Storage in binary tree 32-bit array
- Path computation: current level is the least significant bit, on left shift per level
- Binary index in the array: ((path | (1 << level)) - 1) or (path + (2^maxLevel >> (maxLevel-level)))
- Binary index to array index: (index >> 3)
- Binary index to bit index: (index & 7)

- maxLevel=23 -> ~2MB voxel buffer management -> ~1GB CPU voxel buffer, ~1GB GPU voxel buffer -> ~1000m^3 voxel data at its lowest level

Voxel buffer on CPU and GPU are synchronized

Voxel strucuture on the GPU
- 32-bit structure: 1-active, 3-index, 4-parent, 8-children, 1-search, 7-activity, (8-unused)
- 32-bit children: 32-pointer (absolute, refer to the block of voxel data (4*4=16 bytes))
- 40 bit colour: 6-pred, 6-pgreen, 6-pblue, 6-beta,
                 5-mred, 5-pgreen, 5-pblue, 1-emitter
- 24 bit light: 6-sreds, 6-sgreens, 6-sblues, 6-shighs

- 32 bit unused: (32-unused)

Voxel buffer dynamics
- Loading of voxels in order (root -> recursion on children) by requests from the GPU and CPU
- Unloading by suggestions from the GPU checked by the CPU

GPU loading suggestions
- set children mask but unset first child pointer represent unloaded children
- 7-bit last render timestamp (time - voxel)
- 1-bit search flag
  - update to 0 by childless leaf voxel
  - binary OR recursive parent update
  - binary search from the root for voxels to load or unload
  - reset to 1 at the end of the frame
- memory pressure level calculated by the CPU (default to 127, maximum at 1)
- unused voxels with fallow period >= memory pressure is suggested to the CPU for unloading

CPU unloading checks
- calculation of the current memory pressure via the amount of memory needs to be inserted and how much space is left
- only unloading of voxel data which isn't in very close proximity to the player (but not in full detail) or needed for physics

Voxel material on the GPU
- Voxel material colour system
  - "A physically Based Colour Model" by Robert J Oddy, Philip J Willis
  - ratio of particle and medium colour defined by beta value
- Voxel baked lighting system
  - local lookup table for colour values: 5-cubes, 3-sides
  - light memory stores
    - average light value: 255 * cubes / 27 * (2 * sides + highs) / (3 * sides)
    - side dependent variations (WORK IN PROGRESS)
  - front light: previous voxel's light / (1, 1, 1) for emitter voxels
  - back light: next voxel's light

Pixel calculation
- Init: RGBpixel = (0, 0, 0); RGBback = (1, 1, 1); RGBlight = (0, 0, 0); buf;
- Input: RGBparticle, beta, RGBmedium, RGBlfore, RGBlback
- Algorithm: buf = (beta * RGBparticle * RGBlfore) + RGBlight
             RGBpixel += RGBback * buf * beta / max(buf.r, buf.g, buf.b, beta);
             RGBback *= (1 - beta) * RGBmedium;
             RGBlight = 8 * sqrt(RGBlback);
